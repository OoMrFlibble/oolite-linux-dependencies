# Oolite Updater Script
# Dylan Smith, 2005-09-10
#
# Konstantinos Sykas
# 2009-09-22: rsync to alternative server
# 2009-10-13: x86_64 support
# 2010-04-23: 1) Improved x86_64 detection
#             2) Improved exit-message when no new Oolite version is available
# 2011-03-22: Removed TOPLEVEL environment variable. A small fix in the default.*.apspec file
#             made TOPLEVEL obsolete. OOLITE_ROOT is more than enough.
